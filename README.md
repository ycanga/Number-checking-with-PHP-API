# Number-checking-with-PHP-API
Using a free API with PHP, general information about your mobile number is retrieved and printed on the screen.

** Before running this project, I would like to state that you must have Domain and Hosting. Otherwise, the project will not work in the local environment.

Each user must have an API key for this project to work. Please create a user account <a href="https://rapidapi.com/">here</a> and write down your API key.
Then login to your account and go to the site <a href="https://rapidapi.com/larroyouy70/api/phonenumbervalidatefree/">here</a> then copy the key in the "X-RapidAPI-Key" section.

After these operations, we paste the copied key into the "X-RapidAPI-Key" section in the "phone_number_check.php" file.
